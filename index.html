<h1>Part 3: Implementation</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Below is my implementation of the visualisation I designed for Q2: "â€œAnalyse regional house prices in the UK. Are there any differences between regions?".</li>
    <li>I was unable to get a GeoJSON map working with all regions of the UK however, so I have kept to England only.</li>
    <li>To create this, I combined the housing dataset given on KEATS with a London specific house price dataset I found online (referenced in my report). The JSON file is included in the zipped submission folder.</li>
    <li>For each region of England, the average price of the four quarters of 2023. For the London boroughs, the most recent dataset was from 2017.</li>
    <li>This implementation was inspired by and adapted from the template given here: https://codepen.io/bwiacek/pen/pXZEvK.</li>
